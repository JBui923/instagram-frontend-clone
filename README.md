## Conclusion
Flexagram was a bit of a challenge using AWS S3 bucket and react-dropzone to upload images. It was a struggle to figure out how that connected. After reading around and asking others it finally worked and becomes one of the biggest core features of the project. Although Flexagram is far from complete it is a MVP, that I look forward to working on even futher in the future.
